# stack-and-priority-q
 * Project 2 class starts by creating a Country object, arrays of Country objects, a stack (using Stack class), and a priority queue (using PriorityQ class).
 * All of these are empty or null and the user is asked for a file (Countries2.csv) that Project2 class then parses to fill the arrays, stack and queue.
 * The arrays are simply created to fill the stack and priority queue. The stack is simply filled from bottom to top.
 * The priority queue is organized from highest priority to lowest priority, the lowest case fatality rate being the highest priority and the highest case fatality rate
 * being the lowest priority.
 * After the stack and queue are filled, the user is prompted repeatedly to enter a number corresponding to an action on a menu, until 7 is entered, 
 * then the program will terminate.
